Hi there - welcome! 🥳 Thrilled to have you here. 👋

Here's what you need to know about this app:

It's all about investment flows - imagine a river of money, and we help you see where it's going. 📈🌊💸 This insight can hint at market trends and possibly point to the next big thing. 🎯💰

We dive deep into funds to fetch these numbers for you. 🕵️‍♂️🔍 And guess what? It's completely free! 🎉

You might wonder, is there a catch? Absolutely not! 🚫 We just believe more information makes markets fairer. 📘👍

But we won't sugarcoat it - analysing every single fund out there is a hefty task! 🏋️‍♀️ So, consider this version of the app as just the beginning. There's more to come, so stay tuned! 📲
            
We've kick-started with a few hundred European "UCITS" vehicles, but remember, there are thousands more out there. 🌍📈 And we're continuously adding them!

For now, these figures may be more accurate in a European context. 🇪🇺 But rest assured, as we enhance our calculations and incorporate more funds (including non-European ones), the accuracy will improve over time. ⏳📊

For now, treat the numbers as rough estimates or 'toy figures'. 🪁🔢 They're here to spark your curiosity and help you ask the right questions. 🕵️‍♀️🔎
            
Most importantly, we hope you have fun exploring! 🚀
